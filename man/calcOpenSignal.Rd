\alias{calcOpenSignal}
\title{The function calcOpenSignal takes the input BED file, overlaps it with all
defined open chromatin regions across cell types and returns a matrix, 
where each row is the input genomic region (if overlap was found), each 
column is a cell type, and the value is a normalized ATAC-seq signal.}
\usage{
calcOpenSignal(query, cellMatrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Genomic regions to be analyzed. Can be in GRanges or 
GRangesList format.}

\item{cellMatrix}{Matrix with open chromatin signal values, rows are genomic
regions, columns are cell types. First column contains 
information about the genomic region in following form: 
chr_start_end. Can be either data.frame or data.table.}
}
\value{
A data.table with cell specific open chromatin signal values for query 
regions.
}
