In the getting started vignette, we used convenience wrapper functions to explore how your regions are distributed across some common features and partitions in human reference assemblies. That's great if you just want the basics, but really, `GenomicDistributions` is more powerful and flexible, and can run the same analysis on any kind of genomic feature from any reference genome. This vignette will show you how to do this.

Here, we'll show you how to use your own features:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library("GenomicDistributions")
queryFile = system.file("extdata", "vistaEnhancers.bed.gz", package="GenomicDistributions")
query = rtracklayer::import(queryFile)

EnsDb = loadEnsDb("hg19")
featsWide = ensembldb::genes(EnsDb, columns=c("gene_biotype"))

# Now, restrict to protein-coding genes and grab just a single base pair at the TSS
feats = promoters(featsWide[featsWide$gene_biotype == "protein_coding"], 1, 1)

# Change from ensembl-style chrom annotation to UCSC_style
seqlevels(feats) = paste0("chr", seqlevels(feats))

featDist = calcFeatureDist(query, feats)

# Then plot the result:
plotFeatureDist(featDist, featureName="my features")

```

More details to come.
